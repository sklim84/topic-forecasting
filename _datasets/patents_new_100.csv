2017-04-25,"Blockchain identity management system based on public identities ledger. The invention describes an identity management system (IDMS) based on the concept of peer-to-peer protocols and the public identities ledger. The system manages digital identities, which are digital objects that contain attributes used for the identification of persons and other entities in an IT system and for making identity claims. The identity objects are encoded and cryptographically encapsulated. Identity management protocols include the creation of identities, the validation of their binding to real-world entities, and their secure and reliable storage, protection, distribution, verification, updates, and use. The identities are included in a specially constructed global, distributed, append-only public identities ledger. They are forward- and backward-linked using the mechanism of digital signatures. The linking of objects and their chaining in the ledger is based on and reflect their mutual validation relationships. The identities of individual members are organized in the form of linked structures called the personal identities chains. Identities of groups of users that validated identities of other users in a group are organized in community identities chains. The ledger and its chains support accurate and reliable validation of identities by other members of the system and by application services providers without the assistance of third parties. The ledger designed in this invention may be either permissioned or unpermissioned. Permissioned ledgers have special entities, called BIX Security Policy Providers, which validate the binding of digital identities to real-world entities based on the rules of a given security policy. In unpermissioned ledgers, community members mutually validate their identities. The identity management system provides security, privacy, and anonymity for digital identities and satisfies the requirements for decentralized, anonymous identities management systems."

In addition, system, method, and computer program product described herein may provide the capability for users to be able to control the confidentiality of their transactions, for the system to control access to transactions, for the system to be capable of auditing transactions, and to provide accountability of the validating entities."
2018-06-05,"Systems and methods for digital identity management and permission controls within distributed network nodes. Embodiments disclosed herein provide systems and methods for digital identity management and permission controls within distributed network nodes. A network node may receive a request to generate a new digital identity record for an entity. The network node may retrieve a template based on an entity type; and receive information, reference documents, and biometric information for the new digital identity record. The network node may associate and store the received information to the data fields in the new digital identity record, generate respective one directional cryptographic hashes of the reference documents and the biometric information, and store the hashes in the new digital identity record while storing the reference documents and biometric information in a non-blockchain repository. The network node may generate a digital identity record block for the new digital identity record, encrypt the digital identity record block, and append the encrypted block to the latest valid blockchain."
2018-06-05,"Systems and methods for generating and maintaining immutable digital meeting records within distributed network nodes. Embodiments disclosed herein provide systems and methods for digital meeting management within a blockchain. Before a meeting, a computer may generate a digital meeting record containing a plurality of data fields and linked to various smart contracts to capture meeting activities. During the meeting, a first smart contract may authenticate and record attendees in the digital meeting record based on biometric information received from the attendees' devices. Furthermore, a second smart contract may capture in the digital meeting record, meeting actions of each attendee, including date, time, and location associated with the meeting actions. After the meeting, a third smart contract may autopopulate post meeting documentation. After review by the attendees, the third smart contract may store a hash of the documentation to the digital meeting record and store the documentation in a repository. Once appended to the blockchain, the digital meeting record becomes an immutable record of the meeting."
2018-06-05,"System and method for creating an opinion and behavioral data economy. A system and method for the opinion economy that allows a user to make a choice of what data, demographics, opinions, behaviors, beliefs, and other information to share. The system and method provides capability to a user to set a value for that user's data, opinions, behaviors, and beliefs. The system and method further allows for dynamic pricing for surveys or data collection, either dependent on length of time, effort given by the user, or other attributes that might drive the value the user sets on that user's participation."
2018-06-12,Non-parity in grid encoded data storage systems. Techniques for encoding data storage systems using grid-encoded data storage systems with non-parity linear redundancy encoding schemes are described herein. A grid of shards with derived shards and data shards is generated that is indexed by a first index and a second index and is configured so that each shard is reproducible from other shards with the same first index and is also reproducible from other shards with the same second index. The grid of shards is further configured so that each data row of the grid of shards has at least two derived shards and at least twice as many data shards as derived shards.
2018-06-12,"Hardware blockchain consensus operating procedure enforcement. A system may provide hardware acceleration for blockchain-based record entry. Client circuitry may provide record entry information to node circuitry. The node circuitry may compile the record entry information into a record entry for submission to blockchain management circuitry (BMC). The BMC may access a consensus operating procedure. The BMC may apply the consensus operating procedure to the record entry to gain append permissions for a blockchain. After completing the consensus operating procedure, the BMC may append a block generated based on the record entry to the blockchain. Accordingly, the system may ensure that blocks added to the blockchain were generated in compliance with the consensus operating procedure."
